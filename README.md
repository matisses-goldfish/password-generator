## Desciprtion
---
This application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runa in the browser and featurea dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Reference:

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
## Process:
1. Pseudocode-
* A large step of creating comprehensive JavaScript is learning how to Pseudocode. Pseudocode not only allowed me to create a step by step process of what exactly I needed to inclde in my JavaScript to create  working functions. 

2. Research-
* Seeing all the Pseudocode, I was able to research similar projects and design features on sites such as Stack Overflow, MDN, and GitHub. From there, I was able to apply certain concepts to my JavaScript to make my code more compact and efficent. Concept examples: concat, input validation format, and Math.random

    > EX: I had a dificult time drafting a concept for taking my vers and creating the finished password product. I decided to look through past samples of similar projects to see how I could include my concats in my math.random portion of the project. I was able to use that concept and apply it to my own code. (source credit is below and commented in my code.)

3. Apply-
* Following my research and Pseudocode, I applied my understanding of what needed to occur with the given prompt and worked from there.

4. Debugging- 
* From there, I went through my code and tested certain functions, to which I responsed and found errors and solutions that could improve and enhance my working javascript.
